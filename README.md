## Random Forest and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks classiﬁers applied to a breast cancer dataset
In this project, we examine the eﬃciency of classiﬁers on the accuracy of classifying the masses in the dataset as benign/malignant. 10-fold cross validation procedure has been performed for both algorithms. The results of this cross validation show that the neural network model has a better performance to predict breast cancer tumors than a random forest model. This study reveals that the machine learning algorithms could provide improved accuracy for early prediction of cancerous tumors.
